At the very beginning, it define the concept of Homo Sapiens and explain it through the revolution from Big Bang, atom, modules, organisms, culture and history. Then, Uniqueness of Homo Sapiens was introduced compared to other sepices such as other human/sister/brother, Lions, etc. The idea is the deep cooperations based on mythtical stories when the group is large enough. Though stable interlinks sharing the same faith, sapiens become domoniant as the top of prymaid. Usage of tools inspired by big brains recharged via having cooked food to kill other animals enact human stand out. Next, description for the progress for how the sapiens behave is taken into consideration as a context of history instead only the arena of biology. If we want have a better understanding about ourself, we research on nature of archatic forager. This relys on the archelogical finds on bias of their daily life. However, the short duration of such forager existence and unavailability of artifact in findings makes the investigation problmatic. Anothe solution would be to know the social stucture of modern survived forager, then speculate the way their ancetor lives. This path also posses problems, like the effect on social structure of foragers due to the industrial development, the limited representation of less population of modern foragers for inhospitable area, and cultural distinction even in the same region.
